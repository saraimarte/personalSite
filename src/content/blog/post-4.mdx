import { Prism } from '@astrojs/prism';

I needed a way to style my code blocks in my mdx files. 

I learned about <a href = "https://prismjs.com/">Prisma</a> and that it's built into Astro.

Here is how I set it up in this website. 

**1.** This is how your astro.config.mjs should look like:

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [mdx()],
  markdown: {
   syntaxHighlight: "prism",
  },
});
`} />


**2.** Go to the <a href = "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/tree/master">Prism Themes Collection</a>, pick one that you like, download it and place it in your public folder. I chose the prism-holi-theme. I edited it a bit to be more mobile friendly.

**3.** Place the following code in your `<head></head>` tag (make sure you replace 'prism-holi-theme' with the name of *your* theme.)

<Prism lang="html" code={`<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "../../public/prism-holi-theme.css"/>`} />


**4.** In any mdx file, paste the following code after the frontmatter.

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`import { Prism } from '@astrojs/prism';`} />

````markdown
<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const jsCode = "this is javascript code!"`} />
````

and then you should see the following code snippet on your page...

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const jsCode = "this is javascript code!"`} />

**Tip:** To render the following line on this page:

````markdown
<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const jsCode = "this is javascript code!"`} />
````

instead of doing this, 

````markdown
<Prism lang="javascript" code={`

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const jsCode = "this is javascript code!"`} />

`} />
````

which gives you an error, you would surround it by markdown ticks like so, 

`````markdown
````markdown
<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const jsCode = "this is javascript code!"`} />
````
`````
