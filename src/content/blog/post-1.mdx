Components

import Card from '@components/Card.astro';
import TweetCard from '@components/TweetCard.astro';

```
Images
```
import img from '../../../public/img4.png';
import img2 from '../../../public/img6.jpg';

This bordered card component supports various media types—images, videos, and tweets—ensuring they fit within the borders while remaining centered and responsive, regardless of content size.

Current Issues: Tweet may be too large (height) on mobile.

Here ares some examples using the component with different media types: 

## 1. Large Width Image

<Card img = {img} alt = "When to do dx or dy in Disk Method?"></Card>

## 2. Large Height Image

<Card img = {img2} alt = "Telescoping Series Solution"></Card>

## 3. Tweet

<Card >

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chinese open weights model that easily surpasses all previous models, both closed and open, at MATH: <a href="https://t.co/3DEotq76hY">https://t.co/3DEotq76hY</a></p>&mdash; Jeremy Howard (@jeremyphoward) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1821557546102174194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

</Card>

## 4. Youtube Video

<Card >

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tuT9Mp-Cnck?si=e8yspLZ8Tvo__8ty" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</Card>

Notes:

For the iframe to be responsive I had to add this to the Global CSS file : (uh you cant see it yet bc for some reason the three back ticks are not displaying the code. That's a problem for tomorrow.)

```
iframe{
    width: 600px;
    height: 400px;;
}
  
@media (max-width: 768px) {
iframe {
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
}
}
```
