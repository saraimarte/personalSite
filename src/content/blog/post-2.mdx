# How to create a simple web component

<a href = "https://replit.com/@smartebio/webcomponent">Web Component with ShadowDOM repl.it</a> 

<a href = "https://replit.com/@smartebio/webcomponent2">Web Component without ShadowDOM repl.it</a>

First, create the file for the web component.

The file naming convention is to seperate all words with dashes.

Let's say I want to create a component that displays a red heading that reads "Hello World".

I would name the component "hello-world.js".

<DropDown title = "hello-world.js (with ShadowDOM)">

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`
class HelloWorld extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    // this makes sure that the HTMLElement stuff actually is initiated 
    super();
    
    //this makes sure that the component won't be affected
    // by any external styles or scripts outside of this file
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });

    //this displays the component
    this.render();
  }

  render() {
    const headerHTML = \`
      <style>
        .red {
          color:red;
        }
        
      </style>

      <h1 class = "red" id = "helloWorld" >Hello World</h1>
      
    \`;
    if (this.shadowRoot) {
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = headerHTML;
    }
  }
}

//This registers the HelloWorld class as a custom element with the tag name 'hello-world'/.
customElements.define('hello-world', HelloWorld);

`} />
</DropDown>

Web components are custom elements *with* a shadow dom but we can technically make them without. 

This way, it's easier to access and work with them in your scripts but remember that you're sacrificing the benefits of encapsulation. 

<DropDown title = "hello-world.js (without ShadowDOM)">

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`
class HelloWorld extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = \`
      <style>
        .red {
          color: red;
        }
      </style>
      <h1 class = "red" id = "helloWorld">Hello World</h1>
    \`;
  }
}

customElements.define('hello-world', HelloWorld);

`} />
</DropDown>

Now, in your html file import the component like so, 

<Prism lang="html" code={`  <script src="hello-world.js"></script>`} />

Now, you can use it as an HTML element like so,

<Prism lang="html" code={`<body>

    <hello-world> </hello-world>

</body>
`} />

and you will now see the web component on your page, 

<Card img = {img1} alt = "Displays hello world component in red on the screen"/>

<DropDown title = "index.html">

<Prism lang="html" code={
`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-wsidth">
  <title>Web Component Example</title>
  <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
</head>

<body>

  <!-- 2. Add the component to the page -->
  <hello-world> </hello-world>

  <!-- 1. Import the web component -->
  <script src="hello-world.js"></script>   

  <!--Import the js script -->
  <script src="script.js"></script>

</body>

</html>

`} />

</DropDown>

# How to access the web component using JavaScript.

Now, the difference in adding the shadowDOM or not is shown when we try to access the 'web component' within a script tag once it's been added to the page. 

I put web component in quotes because the misconception is that we try to access the web component when really we are trying to access the element inside the web component. 

## Selecting h1 with ShadowDOM

Recall: querySelector selects the first element in the DOM that meets the condition. 

If we try the following, 
<Prism lang="javascript" code={
`  const h1 = document.querySelector("#helloWorld");
  console.log(h1);
`} />

we get 'null' in the console because the element h1 with an id of helloWorld can't be found meaning it does not exist in the DOM. 

But didn't we add the component that **is** an h1 element with an id of helloWorld? 

No, we added a web component that **contains** an h1 element with an id of HelloWorld. 

Here is what the web component looks like with the Shadow DOM, 

<Card img = {img3} alt = "Web component added to the html with a shadowDOM"/>

You can see that the actual element h1 is nested inside the web component.

**Hence, think of a web component as a container that contains the actual element you want to display on the screen.**

In other words, we just have to keep on digging so you would do something like this, 

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const h1 = document.querySelector("hello-world").shadowRoot.querySelector("#helloWorld");`} />

First, we select the web component (the container) 'hello-world'. 

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const h1 = document.querySelector("hello-world");`} />

Then we go inside it's shadowRoot and inside the shadowRoot we search for the first element we find with id of 'helloWorld', 

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const h1 = document.querySelector("hello-world").shadowRoot.querySelector("#helloWorld");`} />

and boom! the h1 element is returned to you in the console like so, 

<Prism lang="html" code={`<h1 class="red" id="helloWorld">Hello World</h1>`} />

## Selecting h1 without ShadowDOM

Selecting the element without a shadowRoot is easier because there is less digging. 

<Card img = {img2} alt = "Web component added to the html without a shadowDOM"/>

Simply, remove the shadowRoot selection. 

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const h1 = document.querySelector("hello-world").querySelector("#helloWorld");`} />

and you will be able to access your h1 element, 

<Prism lang="html" code={`<h1 class="red" id="helloWorld">Hello World</h1>`} />

# Dynamically adding web components to the DOM 

<Prism lang="javascript" code={

`//Dynamically add the hello-world component to the DOM

//Get the body
const body = document.querySelector("body");

//Create the hello-world component as an object in js
const myElement = document.createElement('hello-world');

//Add the component to the body
body.appendChild(myElement);`} />

<Card img = {img6} alt = "Shows another hello-world component being added to the DOM dynamically. "/>

Now, that we learned how to access the 'web component', let's explore what we can do with it after it's added to the HTML. 

# Changing the styles of the web component dynamically (via javascript)

Let's say we want to change the heading from red to green.

We can just go into the hello-world.js file and manually change the color styles but how can we do it via javascript?

Well, we can simply access the color styles like so,

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`h1.style.color = "green";`} />

<Card img = {img4} alt = "Displays hello world in green"/>

That works but we can also have a class called green in our style sheet and apply that class...or can we?

If we add a green class in our style.css, 

<Prism lang="css" code={
`.green{
  color:green;
}`} />

and in our script.js add that class to the h1 element, 

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`h1.classList.add("green");`} />

you will notice that the color did not change to green like we told it to.

The reason why is because that class 'green' is *not* in the styles of the web component file.

**Rule: In order for you to dynamically add a class later on, that class already needs to be stored in the web component file inside the style sheet.**

Delete everything in your style sheet and add the green class to 'hello-world.js'.

<Card img = {img5} alt = "H1 element turns green after adding to it's classList a green class that refers to the class inside the web component file and not the style.css"/>

Notice, how now the h1 is green!

Even though we told it to be red in the web component file, we later added a green class in the script.js file.

The important part is **that green class we added in script.js refers to the class we placed inside the style tags in the web component file and *not* any class in the style sheet.** Why? Because styles are encapsulated in web components. No styles go in and no styles inside the web component affect any elements outside (<a href = "https://nolanlawson.com/2021/01/03/options-for-styling-web-components/">with some exceptions.</a>)

So when we had that green class in the style sheet and it would not turn green it was because the web component could not read from any styles outside it's little world.

Now, all of this was for a simple web component. What if you want a web component that takes in an attribute like your name and says "Hello, [Your Name]"?

How do we pass in attributes to the component and how do we dynamically add it to the page?

# How to create a web component that takes in attributes

<a href = "https://replit.com/@smartebio/webComponentAttributes#hello-comp.js">Repl.it</a> 

<DropDown title = "hello-comp.js">

<Prism lang="javascript" code={
`// Define a new custom element class named 'HelloComp' that extends HTMLElement
class HelloComp extends HTMLElement {


  // This constructor 'constructs' the component
  //This runs everytime the component is called
  constructor() {
    super(); // Call the constructor of the parent class (HTMLElement)
    // Attach a shadow DOM to the custom element with open mode
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
    // Call the render method to display the initial content
    this.render();
  }

  // Define which attributes to observe for changes
  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ['name', 'age']; // Watch 'name' and 'age' attributes
  }

  // Callback function that is called when an observed attribute changes
  attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {
    // Only proceed if the attribute value has changed
    if (oldValue !== newValue) {
      // Update internal properties based on the attribute name
      switch(name) {
        case 'name':
          this._name = newValue; // Store new name value
          break;
        case 'age':
          this._age = newValue; // Store new age value
          break;
      }
      // Re-render the element to reflect the updated attributes
      this.render();
    }
  }

  // Callback function that is called when the element is added to the DOM
  connectedCallback() {
    // Initialize internal properties with current attribute values
    this._name = this.getAttribute('name');
    this._age = this.getAttribute('age');
    // Render the element for the first time
    this.render();
  }

  // Method to render the HTML content of the element
  render() {
    // Define the HTML template with styles and content
    const headerHTML = \`
      <style>
        .red {
          color: red; // Style for text color
        }
      </style>

      <h1 class="red" id="helloWorld">Hello \${this._name}. Wow, you're \${this._age}!</h1>
    \`;
    // Update the shadow DOM with the new HTML content
    if (this.shadowRoot) {
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = headerHTML;
    }
  }
}

// Register the custom element with the browser
customElements.define('hello-comp', HelloComp);`} />

</DropDown>

Then, in your html you can import the component and use it like so, 

<DropDown title = "index.html">

<Prism lang="html" code={
`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  <title>replit</title>
  <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
</head>

<body>

  <!-- Import script.js file -->
  <script src="script.js"></script>

  <!-- 1. Import component -->
  <script src="hello-comp.js"></script>
  
  <!-- 2. Add component with it's attributes-->
  <hello-comp name = "Sarai" age = "20"></hello-comp>

</body>

</html>`}/>
</DropDown>

and that returns, 

<Card img = {img7} alt = "Displays the hello component on screen with attributes passed in."/>

What if you want to add the attributes dynamically? Depending on what the user inputs in your site?

# Dynamically adding web components with attributes to the DOM

Well, let's create a form that takes in a user's name and age and returns a message. 

<DropDown title = "index.html">
<Prism lang="html" code={
`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  <title>replit</title>
  <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
</head>

<body>
  <script src="hello-comp.js"></script>

  <form name="myForm" action="" method="GET">
    <label for="nameBox">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" name="nameBox" value="" id="nameBox"/>

    <br/>

    <label for="ageBox">Age:</label>
    <input type="text" name="ageBox" value="" id="ageBox"/>

    <br/>

    <button type="submit" onClick="displayMessage(event, this.form)" >Submit</button>
  </form>

  <div class = "message"></div>

  <script src="script.js"></script>

</body>

</html>
`}/>

</DropDown>
<DropDown title = "script.js">
<Prism lang="javascript" code={
`function displayMessage(event, form) {

  //This is so the page doesn't reset everytime we click on submit
  event.preventDefault()

  //Get the name from the form
  const name = form.nameBox.value;
  //Get the age from the form
  const age = form.ageBox.value;

  //Create the component
  const component = document.createElement("hello-comp");

  //Pass in the attributes name and age that we got above into that component
  component.setAttribute("name", name);
  component.setAttribute("age", age);

  //Get the container where the message will appear
  const messageContainer = document.querySelector(".message");
  
  //Erase the previous message
  messageContainer.textContent = "";
  //Add the new message
  messageContainer.appendChild(component);
}`}/>
</DropDown>

and you will see, 

<Card img = {img12} alt = "Displays 'Hello Sarai. Wow, you're 20!' after submitting 'Sarai' for name and '20' for age. "/>

and that's all I have for now! See ya.
