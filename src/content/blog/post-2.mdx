# How to Create a Simple Web Component

<a href = "https://replit.com/@smartebio/webcomponent">Web Component with ShadowDOM repl.it</a> 

<a href = "https://replit.com/@smartebio/webcomponent2">Web Component without ShadowDOM repl.it</a>

First, create the file for the web component.

The file naming convention is to seperate all words with dashes.

Let's say I want to create a component that displays a red heading that reads "Hello World".

I would name the component "hello-world.js".

<DropDown title = "hello-world.js (with ShadowDOM)">

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`
class HelloWorld extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    // this makes sure that the HTMLElement stuff actually is initiated 
    super();
    
    //this makes sure that the component won't be affected
    // by any external styles or scripts outside of this file
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });

    //this displays the component
    this.render();
  }

  render() {
    const headerHTML = \`
      <style>
        .red {
          color:red;
        }
        
      </style>

      <h1 class = "red" id = "helloWorld" >Hello World</h1>
      
    \`;
    if (this.shadowRoot) {
      this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = headerHTML;
    }
  }
}

//This registers the HelloWorld class as a custom element with the tag name 'hello-world'/.
customElements.define('hello-world', HelloWorld);

`} />
</DropDown>

Web components are custom elements *with* a shadow dom but we can technically make them without. 

This way, it's easier to access and work with them in your scripts but remember that you're sacrificing the benefits of encapsulation. 

<DropDown title = "hello-world.js (without ShadowDOM)">

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`
class HelloWorld extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = \`
      <style>
        .red {
          color: red;
        }
      </style>
      <h1 class = "red" id = "helloWorld">Hello World</h1>
    \`;
  }
}

customElements.define('hello-world', HelloWorld);

`} />
</DropDown>

Now, in your html file import the component like so, 

<Prism lang="html" code={`  <script src="hello-world.js"></script>`} />

Now, you can use it as an HTML element like so,

<Prism lang="html" code={`<body>

    <hello-world> </hello-world>

</body>
`} />

and you will now see the web component on your page, 

<Card img = {img1} alt = "Displays hello world component in red on the screen"/>

<DropDown title = "index.html">

<Prism lang="html" code={
`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-wsidth">
  <title>Web Component Example</title>
  <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
</head>

<body>

  <!-- 2. Add the component to the page -->
  <hello-world> </hello-world>

  <!-- 1. Import the web component -->
  <script src="hello-world.js"></script>   

  <!--Import the js script -->
  <script src="script.js"></script>

</body>

</html>

`} />

</DropDown>

# How to access the web component using JavaScript.

Now, the difference in adding the shadowDOM or not is shown when we try to access the 'web component' within a script tag once it's been added to the page. 

I put web component in quotes because the misconception is that we try to access the web component when really we are trying to access the element inside the web component. 

## Selecting h1 with ShadowDOM

Recall: querySelector selects the first element in the DOM that meets the condition. 

If we try the following, 
<Prism lang="javascript" code={
`  const h1 = document.querySelector("#helloWorld");
  console.log(h1);
`} />

we get 'null' in the console because the element h1 with an id of helloWorld can't be found meaning it does not exist in the DOM. 

But didn't we add the component that **is** an h1 element with an id of helloWorld? 

No, we added a web component that **contains** an h1 element with an id of HelloWorld. 

Here is what the web component looks like with the Shadow DOM, 

<Card img = {img3} alt = "Web component added to the html with a shadowDOM"/>

You can see that the actual element h1 is nested inside the web component.

**Hence, think of a web component as a container that contains the actual element you want to display on the screen.**

In other words, we just have to keep on digging so you would do something like this, 

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const h1 = document.querySelector("hello-world").shadowRoot.querySelector("#helloWorld");`} />

First, we select the web component (the container) 'hello-world'. 

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const h1 = document.querySelector("hello-world");`} />

Then we go inside it's shadowRoot and inside the shadowRoot we search for the first element we find with id of 'helloWorld', 

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const h1 = document.querySelector("hello-world").shadowRoot.querySelector("#helloWorld");`} />

and boom! the h1 element is returned to you in the console like so, 

<Prism lang="html" code={`<h1 class="red" id="helloWorld">Hello World</h1>`} />

## Selecting h1 without ShadowDOM

Selecting the element without a shadowRoot is easier because there is less digging. 

<Card img = {img2} alt = "Web component added to the html without a shadowDOM"/>

Simply, remove the shadowRoot selection. 

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`const h1 = document.querySelector("hello-world").querySelector("#helloWorld");`} />

and you will be able to access your h1 element, 

<Prism lang="html" code={`<h1 class="red" id="helloWorld">Hello World</h1>`} />

# Changing the web component via Javascript 

Now, that we learned how to access the 'web component', let's explore what we can do with it after it's added to the HTML. 

## Changing the styles 

Let's say we want to change the heading from red to green.

We can just go into the hello-HelloWorld.js file and manually change the color styles but how can we do it via javascript?

Well, we can simply access the color styles like so,

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`h1.style.color = "green";`} />

<Card img = {img4} alt = "Displays hello world in green"/>

That works but we can also have a class called green in our style sheet and apply that class...or can we?

If we add a green class in our style.css, 

<Prism lang="css" code={
`.green{
  color:green;
}`} />

and in our script.js add that class to the h1 element, 

<Prism lang="javascript" code={`h1.classList.add("green");`} />

you will notice that the color did not change to green like we told it to.

The reason why is because that class 'green' is *not* in the styles of the web component file.

**Rule: In order for you to dynamically add a class later on, that class already needs to be stored in the web component file inside the style sheet.**

Delete everything in your style sheet and add the green class to 'hello-world.js'.

<Card img = {img5} alt = "H1 element turns green after adding to it's classList a green class that refers to the class inside the web component file and not the style.css"/>

Notice, how now the h1 is green!

Even though we told it to be red in the web component file, we later added a green class in the script.js file.

The important part is **that green class we added in script.js refers to the class we placed inside the style tags in the web component file and *not* any class in the style sheet.** Why? Because styles are encapsulated in web components. No styles go in and no styles inside the web component affect any elements outside (<a href = "https://nolanlawson.com/2021/01/03/options-for-styling-web-components/">with some exceptions.</a>)

So when we had that green class in the style sheet and it would not turn green it was because the web component could not read from any styles outside it's little world.
